We might not be able to pay some or all of your claim if you don't. We won't pay any more for a claim than we would have if you'd have told us straight away. For example, if the damage has got worse because you hadn't told us. 1 Before you contact us If you need to claim, there are some things you might have to do before getting in touch with us. \u2022 Please don't make repairs for any reason other than urgent repairs to stop the problem getting worse. For example, turn the water off at the mains, and call a plumber if there's a leaking pipe. We don't cover the costs to repair the pipe, unless: it was damaged by freezing, or it was damaged by accident and you have Buildings with Accidental damage cover. If you need to make urgent repairs, take a photo before and after. Don't throw away any damaged items until we say so. But it's okay to throw away damaged freezer food, just make a list of it first, and take a photo of it too. \u2022 Call the police if something's been stolen, vandalised, or damaged in a riot. They will give you a crime reference number. Call them if you've lost something away from home, and see if you can get a lost property number. \u2022 If something's lost or damaged while travelling, for example, your suitcase on a plane, please report it to the travel company before calling us. \u2022 If you lose a mobile phone, you must tell your service provider right away. \u2022 If someone says you or your family are responsible for an injury or any damage, don't admit blame, or try and negotiate with them. If you do, it might mean we're not able to pay your claim. Please don't reply to any letters or documents from them. Send them to us instead. 2 Contact us Register your claim online 24/7 at: halifax.co.uk/make-a-claim Or call us on 0345 604 6473 Our lines are open 8am-6pm Monday-Friday and 9am-1pm Saturday.

This could be things like a receipt, or valuation you had done. \u2022 We may ask you to prove that your claim happened as you said it did. For example we might need photos, a video or a report from an expert. If we ask for you to give us proof, you must give it to us or we might not be able to pay your claim. You're responsible for paying any costs that are needed to prove your claim. 7 How we'll look after your claim If we accept your claim, there are a few ways we can look to put things right. We'll",

You're responsible for paying any costs that are needed to prove your claim. 7 How we'll look after your claim If we accept your claim, there are a few ways we can look to put things right. We'll try to repair the damage. \u2022 If we can't repair, we'll try to replace. \u2022 We may pay a cash settlement instead. What else do you need to know? If you have other insurance that also covers what you're claiming for, we'll only pay our share of the claim unless we say otherwise in your policy. If we ask, you must give us details of the other policy. If you don't we might not be able to pay the claim. We use other companies (who we call suppliers) to repair or replace your things, and to repair or rebuild your home. Any repair or rebuild work done by our suppliers is guaranteed for at least 12 months. Where we use suppliers, we might get discounts. We will use their cost to us when settling claims. What we mean is, we won't pay more than it would cost us to repair, replace an item or rebuild any part of your home. We'll replace an item with a new item on a like for like basis. When we say 'like for like basis', we mean we'll try to replace it with an exact match. If we can't find an exact match, we'll replace it with the nearest equivalent. By 'nearest equivalent' we mean an item of the same quality and same specification. If we can't find an exact match or nearest equivalent, we'll decide on how much to pay. This will be based on an expert opinion of how much it was worth before it was lost, stolen or damaged. We will only pay up to \u00a32,000 for any contents item unless it is named on your policy. If you have named the item, we will cover it up to the amount you have specified it for. This does not apply to furniture which isn't antique or a home appliance. You don't need to specify these even if they cost more than \u00a32,000. By 'home appliance' we mean an item used for household tasks, like a washing machine or dishwasher. 8 If we decide your buildings need to be repaired, where it's necessary, we'll pay for: \u2022 Architects', surveyors' and legal fees. We must approve the fees first. \u2022 The cost of clearing debris, demolishing buildings, or making them safe. We'll pay the cost of following building regulations and other laws when repairing the damage to your buildings. We won't pay this cost if you were aware that your home did not comply before the damage happened. We might choose to make a payment to you instead of making repairs to your buildings. If we do, the amount we pay will be worked out in one of two ways: 1 We'll either pay you the cost of repairing the damage, but we'll lower the payment to take into account wear and tear. Or, 2 We'll pay the amount the value of your home has fallen by because of the damage. We won't pay more than what it would cost to rebuild it to how it was before the damage. You must let us defend or settle any legal disputes or claims on your behalf. You also must let us take legal action in your name and help us to take legal action if we ask you to. Matching sets and suites Where we've agreed to pay a claim for something that's part of a matching set or suite, we'll always do our best to match it. We'll try to repair the damaged item and, where this isn't possible, we'll look to replace it. We'll carry out thorough searches to make sure that the damaged item is replaced with a reasonable match. This may not be an exact match, but it should look reasonably similar to the rest of the set or suite. This may result in repainting kitchen doors or re-spraying a bathroom sink to match. Where we can't replace the damaged item with a reasonable match, we'll make a cash contribution of 50% towards the cost of replacing the undamaged item forming part of the same set or suite. We won't pay claims for any undamaged items of a uniform nature, colour or design which are not part of a matching",

This doesn't include damage to the home appliance or water or heating system itself. Examples of a home appliance or fixed water or heating system are tanks, pipes, washing machines, or water mains. We'll also pay claims for damage to your buildings caused by water freezing in fixed water or heating systems. This does include the damage caused to the fixed water or heating systems. Tracing and accessing a leak When a leak happens it is sometimes hard to find exactly where it's coming from, so please take all reasonable steps to stop the water and prevent the damage getting worse.
