VoiceAgent Hackathon Project - Summary
=====================================

Project Overview
----------------
You built a voice-enabled insurance policy assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), FastAPI, Gemini LLM, and browser-based voice features. The system answers insurance questions using only indexed policy documents, with a focus on accuracy and no hallucinations.

Key Features Implemented
------------------------
- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction:** Users can ask questions by voice and receive spoken answers.
- **Text-to-Text and Text-to-Voice:** Users can also type questions; answers are shown as text, and spoken only if the question was asked by voice.
- **Short, Factual Answers:** The backend instructs the LLM to answer briefly and always include coverage amounts or limits if available.
- **No Hallucination:** All answers are grounded in indexed policy documents using FAISS vector search.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Handles routing, search, and LLM calls.
- **Gemini LLM:** Provides concise, policy-specific answers.
- **UI Improvements:** Microphone button for voice input, TTS for voice output, and logic to only speak answers for voice input.
- **Word and PowerPoint Exports:** Automated generation of documentation and slides for demo and sharing.

Technical Flow
--------------
1. **User Input:** User asks a question via text or voice in the browser UI.
2. **Speech-to-Text:** If using voice, browser converts speech to text.
3. **Frontend Sends Query:** The question is sent to the FastAPI backend.
4. **RAG Orchestrator:** Backend routes the query to the right agent (policy manager or search assistant).
5. **Vector Search:** Search Assistant uses FAISS to find relevant policy document chunks.
6. **LLM Answer:** Gemini LLM generates a grounded answer using only retrieved document content.
7. **Short, Factual Response:** Backend instructs the LLM to answer briefly and always include coverage numbers if available.
8. **Text-to-Speech:** If the user used voice input, the answer is spoken aloud; otherwise, it's shown as text.

Business Value
--------------
- Reduces customer confusion and support costs.
- Increases policyholder satisfaction and trust.
- Scalable to any insurance product or region.
- Voice-first: accessible to all, including non-technical users.
- Ready for enterprise deployment and future enhancements.
